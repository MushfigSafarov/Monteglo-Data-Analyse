# User Behavior Analysis in the Gaming Industry

Today, we will present a project in which we analyze user behavior in the gaming industry. The gaming market is rapidly evolving, and it is crucial for companies to properly analyze user behavior. Our aim is to demonstrate how various factors – genres, spending patterns, and demographic data – impact the market and, through this analysis, enhance the company’s profitability.

Our company, **Monteglo Studios**, is an Estonia-based gaming and animation studio with over 3.5 million players across 24 countries. To date, it has released 221 games across 28 genres and 25 platforms. The management team consists of Azerbaijani members. This research was conducted with a sample of 100 players, selected through mathematical-statistical sampling – half male and half female – over the past 8 years.

## Distribution of players by gender and genre
Here, we will look at graphs showing the number of comments made by male and female users, the number of players per genre by gender, and the total number of active players per genre.

### 1. Number of Comments by Gender
This graph shows that male users write more comments than female users. The total number of comments written by male players is 2775, while female players have written 2275 comments. This difference could indicate factors affecting the players' interactivity and their activity in sharing thoughts about games. A higher number of comments reflects the active participation of the gaming community and the potential customer engagement for the market.

### 2. Player Count by Genre and Gender
This graph compares the popularity of game genres among male and female players. The **RPG (Role-Playing Game)** genre is the most popular among both genders, with 9 male players and 5 female players choosing RPG games. The most distinct differences are in **Shooter** (shooter games) and **Sport** (sports games) genres. The **Shooter** genre is more popular among males, while female players prefer **Simulation** and **Adventure** genres. These insights are useful for identifying target audiences in the gaming market and developing gender-specific marketing strategies.

### 3. Player Count by Genre
This graph shows that RPG games attract more players than other genres. The **Shooter FPS** (First-Person Shooter) and **Sports Games** genres are in second and third place, respectively. Some genres, such as **MMO** (Massively Multiplayer Online) and **Zombie-Themed Horror Games**, have a lower popularity. This information can help us understand which genres are in high demand and identify gaps in the market.



## Spending and player demographics
Here, we look at graphs comparing total spending by gender, average spending per game, total revenue by genre, and the distribution of players by age group.

### 1. Total Spending by Gender
This graph compares the gaming expenditures of male and female players. Male players have spent a total of $76K, while female players have spent $75K. The spending levels of both genders are quite similar, indicating that both genders contribute almost equally to the financial aspect of the gaming industry. Game companies can use this data to develop marketing strategies targeting both male and female players.

### 2. Average Spending Per Game by Gender
Here, the average spending per game per player is compared. Male players spend an average of $1607 per game, while female players spend $1476 per game. This difference may indicate that male players are more inclined to make in-game purchases and buy additional content. This data is valuable for optimizing monetization strategies within the game.

### 3. Revenue by Genre
When looking at revenue by game genre, **RPG** games generate the highest income. **Shooter** and **Sports** games are also among the highest-earning genres. The genres that generate the least income include **Horror**, **MMO**, and **Puzzle** games. This information can guide game developers on which genres are more profitable to invest in.

### 4. Player Age Groups
This sector graph shows the age distribution of players. 73% of players are between the ages of 18-24, and 27% are between 25-34. This statistic highlights that the core audience of the gaming market is young, and it emphasizes the importance of considering this factor when designing games, marketing campaigns, and content creation.



## Annual trends and development of game genres:
On this page, we examine graphs showing revenue and expense dynamics by year, as well as the number of game genres produced over the years.

### 1. Revenue and Expense Dynamics by Year
This graph shows the development of revenue and expenses between 2016 and 2023. The blue line represents total revenue, while the purple line represents total expenses.  
Between 2016 and 2019, gradual growth in revenue is observed. In 2020, despite steady expenses, revenue sharply increased to $23K, and in 2021, it peaked at $48K. However, from 2022 onward, a decline in revenue is observed, dropping to $19K in 2023.  
The high revenues in 2020 are well understood – they were driven by increased interest in the gaming sector during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, to better understand the 109.9% increase in revenue in 2021 compared to 2020, we should also consider the number of game genres produced each year.


## 2. Number of Game Genres Produced by Year
This chart shows the number of game genres produced over the years.
In 2016, there were 14 genres available. Between 2017 and 2019, this number steadily increased to 26-27. In 2020-2021, the number of new game genres peaked at 40. However, by 2023, this number decreased to 29.
The increase in new genres in 2020-2021 aligns with the company’s strategy to release more games on the market. However, if the revenue growth in 2021 was related to the increase in the number of genres, this growth should have continued in 2022. As seen in the previous chart, this trend only lasted for one year. This suggests that the primary cause of revenue growth in 2021 was not the total number of genres, but the specific increase in production of certain genres. To confirm this, we will look at the "Game Genres Produced by Year" chart.

## 3. Game Genres Produced by Year
This chart shows the distribution of game genres produced by the company between 2016 and 2023. The number of different game genres and the color-coded categories of genres are shown for each year.
In 2021, we observe that more games were produced within a single genre, specifically the RPG (Role-Playing Game) genre. To determine if this really influenced the revenue, we refer to the "Revenue by Genre" chart from the previous page, where we see that the RPG genre generates significantly more revenue compared to other genres.
Based on this conclusion, it is recommended for the company’s marketing and development teams to gradually increase the production of RPG games and focus their PR and advertising strategies on this genre.

## Countries with the majority of customers:
On this page, we will look at the **Countries with the Most Customers** through a map.

### Countries with the Most Customers
This world map shows the geographical distribution of the customer base. Large circles represent the countries with the highest number of users.
**Main markets:** USA, Canada, Brazil, United Kingdom, Germany, Russia, India, China, Australia, and several other countries. The customer share is growing in different regions, proving the international popularity of the games. The company’s primary audience is located in North America, Europe, and Asia.
In some countries, there is no visible player activity at all. For example, countries like Russia, Ukraine, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Romania, Moldova, Czech Republic, Germany, Italy, etc. 
We need to investigate the reasons behind the lack of players in these regions. For instance, it is not difficult to guess why there are no players in Russia and Ukraine. In countries like Italy and Germany, the high cost of setting up game servers is one of the primary reasons for the lack of players. These are countries where gaming culture is widespread, and thus, they offer a large customer and player potential to competitors in the market.
To address these issues, our International Relations and Marketing teams are working harder, and we are currently focusing on expanding in the European market. Of course, steps are also being taken to maintain our existing customer portfolio. For instance, during the carnival and festivals in Brazil, our company provides special gifts and discounts to our players. This is an important indicator for directing marketing strategies toward these regions.

## Player play behaviors and geographical distribution:
On this page, we will look at charts showing **Average Game Play Duration by Gender**, **Geographic Distribution of Players Based on Average Game Play Duration**, and **Total Play Duration by Gender**.

### 1. Average Game Play Duration by Gender
This chart shows the average game play duration for players by gender.
- Average play duration for men: 18,719.14 hours
- Average play duration for women: 16,224.46 hours
- Total average play duration for all players: 17,471.80 hours

Another chart provides the geographical distribution of this data. Different regions show variations in the ratio of male and female players.

### 2. Geographic Distribution of Players Based on Average Game Play Duration by Gender
This chart shows the average game play duration for male and female players across different regions of the world.
- The average play duration for male and female players differs in various countries.
- The chart displays the distribution of male and female players using circular diagrams.
- In some regions, male players dominate, while in others, female players show higher activity.

This data helps understand player behavior by gender in different markets. When designing marketing strategies, it is important to consider where each gender is more active. In certain regions, the increasing activity of female players may require special game content and advertising campaigns for these areas. Overall, this chart is a crucial tool for analyzing the gender balance in the gaming industry.

### 3. Total Play Duration by Gender (Hours)
This chart shows the total play duration by gender in terms of hours:
- Men have played a total of 935,957 hours.
- Women have played a total of 811,223 hours.
This data shows that men spend more time playing games compared to women. However, the difference is relatively small, which indicates that female players are also actively participating.

## Conclusion and Recommendations:
- The gaming market proves to be appealing for both genders.
- Special measures and marketing strategies can be considered to further increase the interest of female players.


## In-game communication statistics:
Here, we will look at the analysis of user communication behaviors during game time, specifically: **Game Time with Opposite Gender Conversation Duration**, **Number of Words Spoken to the Opposite Gender During Game Time**, **Game Time with Same-Gender Conversation Duration**, and **Number of Words Spoken to the Same Gender During Game Time**.

### Analysis of Users' Communication Behaviors During Game Time:
This research investigates the communication behaviors of users – female and male players – with different genders and same-gender players during game time. Some key points have emerged from the analysis:

1. **Game Time with Opposite Gender Conversation Duration (Hours)**
   - Female players spent 161K hours communicating with the opposite gender.
   - Male players spent 127K hours communicating with the opposite gender.
   This shows that women tend to communicate more with the opposite gender during game time. Based on this, we can recommend that the marketing and development teams group female players more with male players during active gameplay to increase the duration of time spent in the game. However, looking at the **Game Time with Same-Gender Conversation Duration** chart, we observe that women spend more time communicating with other women than with the opposite gender. Therefore, we recommend that female players be grouped with other female players during the game.

2. **Number of Words Spoken to the Opposite Gender During Game Time**
   - Male players used 41 million words when speaking to the opposite gender.
   - Female players used 20 million words when speaking to the opposite gender.
   This indicates that men use more words, which could imply they are more communicative or have a gameplay style that requires more verbal interaction. A strategy could be devised to group male players with others who are also more talkative.

3. **Game Time with Same-Gender Conversation Duration (Hours)**
   - Female players spent 206K hours communicating with other women.
   - Male players spent 86K hours communicating with other men.
   This indicates that women spend more time communicating with other women during game time.

4. **Number of Words Spoken to Same-Gender Players During Game Time**
   - Female players spoke 450 million words to other women.
   - Male players spoke 90 million words to other men.
   This shows that women engage in more communication and deeper conversations with other women during game time.

## Outside game communication and conversation dynamics:
Here, we will compare the users' social behaviors outside of the game with their in-game behaviors and analyze the results:

1. **Player's Time Spent Communicating with the Opposite Gender Outside the Game (Hours)**
   - Female players spent 251K hours communicating with the opposite gender outside the game.
   - Male players spent 110K hours communicating with the opposite gender.
   This difference shows that women are more socially active outside the game as well. As seen on the previous page, women tend to communicate more with their same gender. Therefore, marketing and development teams are advised to recommend more female friends to female players.

2. **Number of Words Spoken to the Opposite Gender Outside the Game**
   - Female players spoke 56 million words to the opposite gender outside the game.
   - Male players spoke 46 million words to the opposite gender outside the game.
   This suggests that women communicate more with the opposite gender outside of the game.

3. **Player's Time Spent Communicating with the Same Gender Outside the Game (Hours)**
   - Female players spent 314K hours communicating with other women outside the game.
   - Male players spent 107K hours communicating with other men.
   This data confirms that women are more socially active outside the game as well.

4. **Number of Words Spoken to Same-Gender Players Outside the Game**
   - Female players spoke 560 million words to other women outside the game.
   - Male players spoke 90 million words to other men.
   This shows that women engage in more communication both inside and outside the game, indicating they are socially more active.

> **Note:** Voice analysis software, such as those offered by companies like Verint and NICE Systems, can effectively analyze conversation data without breaching privacy. Also, Python libraries like spaCy and NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) can help identify words used during communication by analyzing text.

## CONCLUSION:
"This analysis shows that the gaming industry is not only a sector for entertainment, but also a market with great economic value. Today, the gaming industry unites over 3 billion people worldwide and generates more than $455 billion in revenue. However, to succeed in this market, it is not enough to just create a great game. Data-driven decisions are crucial for understanding user behavior."

In this presentation, we explored user preferences, spending, and market trend changes. These analyses reveal that tracking market trends and building strategies aligned with user preferences are key factors for success in the gaming industry.

### Conclusion and Recommendations:

- Focus more on **RPG games**.

- Increase marketing efforts in regions like **Europe, South Asia, Latin America**, and the **Baltic states**.

- Work on engaging both **male and female players** in countries such as **Argentina, Egypt, Jamaica, Afghanistan**, and **Pakistan**. Offer special discounts and bonuses to female players on special days and local holidays.

- Group female players more with other female players.

- Integrate **AI** into games. For example, in **Battle Royale** type games, weak AI players can be introduced as opponents to real players, which can further motivate players.

- Add **cross-platform** support so that a game can be played across **PC, mobile, and other platforms**.

- Focus on high-potential and high-revenue regions. **Southeast Asia**, **Brazil**, and especially the **Middle East** and **North Africa** regions should be prioritized. These regions are rapidly growing gaming markets because:
  - The number of mobile gamers is growing rapidly.
  - The younger generation shows significant interest in games and is an active consumer base.
  - Major investments are being made in the gaming industry, especially in countries like **Saudi Arabia** and the **UAE**.
